My daughter and I both use electric toothbrushes, and they're great! The best feature is the automatic timer. They will run for the dentist recommended 2 minutes, and give you a signal every 30 seconds to switch which quadrant of your mouth you are bushing. The problem is that they are big and require recharging. This is really inconvenient when traveling, so we usually just take manual toothbrushes when we go on trips.

But I'm a software engineer! I can build a solution for this. And since I do mostly web development, I'll build it for the web on CodePen!

Yes, there are many toothbrush timer apps on the app stores. But this is simple to build and doesn't need to harvest all of my personal data.
